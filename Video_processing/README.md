# Football Video Analysis  

## Overview  
This project applies **computer vision** and **deep learning** techniques to analyze football match footage. It detects key events, tracks player movements, and extracts insights to enhance performance analysis.  

## Features  
- **Player and Ball Tracking**: Identifies and tracks players and the ball in real-time.  
- **Event Detection**: Recognizes key match events (e.g., goals, fouls, passes).  
- **Tactical Insights**: Extracts positional and movement data for strategic analysis.  

## Technologies  
- **OpenCV** for video processing  
- **YOLO/DeepSORT** for object detection and tracking  
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow** for deep learning models  

## Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/football-video-analysis.git
